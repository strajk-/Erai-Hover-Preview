## Erai Hover Preview

**As of [22.12.24](https://www.erai-raws.info/news/a-new-method-to-generate-a-custom-rss-feed-link/#:~:text=Update%20(Dec%2022%2C%202024)%3A), Erai has introduced their own Poster on Hover feature, which can be enabled in the [user settings](https://www.erai-raws.info/wp-admin/profile.php#:~:text=Extra%20Profile%20Options-,Hovering%20Anime%20Posters,-(Posts)). This makes this extension largely redundant.**

### Why You Might Still Use This Extension
- **Improved Positioning**: The hover preview is carefully positioned to avoid being cut off or going out of bounds, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience.
- **Customizable Scaling**: Define your own scaling for the hover previews, offering a level of customization not available in Erai's implementation.
- **Consideration**: Please note that this extension is slower compared to Erai's built-in feature because it loads the page behind the URL to fetch the specific div containing the poster.

### Description
This extension enhances your browsing experience by displaying hover preview images of anime posters.

Simply hover over anime titles on the front page or in lists, and a preview will appear.
